<h2>HyperRealitIE '14</h2>
<p>Workshop on Hyperrealistic Intelligent Environments 2014 <br/> 30th June. Shanghai, China</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Hyperreality tries to achieve a vision in which virtuality and reality are seamlessly
blended as if they were one, with no distinction on where one ends and the other begins,
blending physical reality with virtual reality and human intelligence with artificial
intelligence[1].</p>

<p>Virtual and augmented reality are used daily as standalone applications in areas such as
computer gaming and mobile devices. Companies such as Google, Nokia and Microsoft are
investing in and developing technology and interfaces to connect the virtual and real
worlds...</p>
